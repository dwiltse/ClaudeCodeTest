3. **Use variety**: Mix multiple choice, scales, and open-ended
4. **Be specific**: "Rate today's session" vs "Rate everything ever"
5. **Allow "Other"**: Give people an escape hatch
6. **Test first**: Fill out your own form to check the flow
7. **Mobile-friendly**: Most people will use their phones

## Question Column Names in Google Sheets

When these questions are exported to Google Sheets, they'll appear as column headers. The names will match your question text, so for easy coding:

**Keep questions concise!**

Instead of: "What is your experience level with data analytics and related technologies?"
